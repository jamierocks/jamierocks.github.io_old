## Hi there,
My name is Jamie and I am a hobbyist programmer, already doing development for [Qixalite](https://forums.qixalite.com/), [Korobi](https://korobi.io/), [Neptune](https://www.neptunepowered.org/) 
and more. I often also dabble in the world of web, specifically developing server-side applications. I occasionally play Minecraft (usually modded) given some time, otherwise you will find me playing some other game, or programming.

## Contact me
If you are ever in the need to contact me, feel free to use any of the following (in preferable order):

* IRC (irc.esper.net) - [#jamierocks](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=jamierocks) or PM `jamierocks`
* Email - jamie@neptunepowered.org
* Twitter - @[LexteamJamie](https://twitter.com/LexteamJamie) (private message me if required)
* Steam - Request in advanced (although you can probably find me easily)
* Skype - don't be silly

## History lesson
I first learnt to program some 5 years ago now, writing some simple websites in HTML (with the aid of CSS), soon after I took a look at PHP, and learnt the basics to make my sites all the more interactive.
Two years on (I think), I then started to learn Java, one of the best decisions I have ever made. This decision was made to allow me to write some plugins for hMod, and later Bukkit and Canary. I also dabbled in Minecraft modding back in 1.2.x and 1.3.x, something of which I have recently returned to.

## Experience with Minecraft Forge
** This section was made as per the request of @TBotV63 **

After a long hiatus from using Forge, I have once more made an appearance (although privately) in the client modding 
world. Currently I am working on a combat mod, an ee2-clone and a super-secret mod.
